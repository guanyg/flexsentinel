# EMU Structural Health Monitoring — Static Flyer

This is a small static webpage / flyer to support customer discovery for a structural health monitoring project at Eastern Michigan University.

Files:
- [index.html](index.html) — main page
- [styles.css](styles.css) — styles
- [script.js](script.js) — small interaction & reveal behavior

Preview locally:

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a static server). Example using Python 3:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Deployment:
- Drag-and-drop to Netlify, or connect the repo to Netlify/Vercel for continuous deploys.

Hero image:
- To use your licensed hero photo, place it at `assets/hero-truck.jpg` in the project root (create an `assets` folder if needed).
- The site will automatically use `assets/hero-truck.jpg` as the hero background (with a dark overlay for text legibility). See `assets/README.txt` for sizing and OG image guidance.

Next steps I can do for you:
- Replace placeholder contact@example.com and example.com links with your real addresses.
- Add your photos, logo, and bios for the team.
- Add analytics, sitemap.xml, and robots.txt for stronger SEO.
- Deploy to Netlify/Vercel and set up a custom domain.

Tell me which content to replace (emails, names, logo) and whether you want me to deploy it.
